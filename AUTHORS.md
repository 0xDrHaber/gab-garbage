Gab Social is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gab-ai-inc/gab-social).
And, that's where we have to stop.

Gab does not publicly disclose the members of our team or their contributions to
this software. All Gab contributions should be regarded as anonymous.

The list of contributors from the
[Mastadon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) project has been removed from
the Gab Social fork of Mastodon to entirely prevent any misinterpretation of our
fork.

## General statements

The Gab Social fork is not endorsed by the Mastadon team. Gab is not receiving
support from the Mastodon team and did not request it.

There has been no communication between the Mastadon and Gab teams regarding
the Gab Social fork.

## Acknowledgement of accomplishments

Gab is grateful for the work performed by the Mastodon team. Their
accomplishments have inspired Gab to completely open the platform, federate the
social network, and take other steps forward in terms of user privacy, user data
control, and trust.

Our hope is that some day circumstances will allow a comprehensive list of
contributors to be displayed for this project because a lot of work went into
this system and it was done by a large number of people who deserve credit for
their accomplishments.
